This project started with the aim of helping my wife to easily publish her books in epub, mobi and pdf formats.

It is an utility in Node.JS which supports docx, odt, markdown, latex and many others as content and takes care of making the compilations.

It's fully open source on github: [https://github.com/GreatWizard/reliure](https://github.com/GreatWizard/reliure).

And my wife books are on [https://academie-des-renards.dunstetter.fr](https://academie-des-renards.dunstetter.fr).
